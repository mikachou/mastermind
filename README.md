# Mastermind

## Overview

This project is a little mastermind game built in C with SDL, that I made during summer 2015, to practice my C language's skills.

## Requirements

To download sourcecode it's easier with git installed. Then you will need `build-essential`  and `make` to compile the project, and `libsdl2` as a dedendency.

On an Ubuntu-derived distro, you can install all these tools with this command as root user :
```
apt install git build-essential make libsdl2-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev
```

## Install

Clone the repository :
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/mikachou/mastermind
```
Enter in just created directory (mastermind by default) then type `make` to build it

Then you will have to type `./mastermind` to execute the project.
